I developed a fully featured scientific calculator with proper operator precedence is implemented, including arithmetic operations, factorials, trig functions and logs to base 2 for solving mathematical problem solutions as a my python internship project.

1. ADDITION OF NUMBERS
2. SUBTRACTION OF NUMBERS
3. MULTIPLICATION OF NUMBERS
4. DIVISION OF NUMBERS
5. MODULUS OF NUMBERS
6. THE ROOTS OR 1/NTH POWER OF A NUMBER
7. THE POWERS AND EXPONENTS
8. THE FACTORIAL OF A NUMBER
9. THE FACTORIAL OF A NUMBER TRIGNOMETRY
10. THE LOGARITHMS OR NATURAL LOGS etc...
and much more... Thank You!!!
